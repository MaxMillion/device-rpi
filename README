This directory defines the board and product configuration for b2g
running on the Raspberry Pi.

The *.bin, *.elf, and *.dat files in prebuilt/ comprise the
proprietary firmware and bootloader files required to start up the
Raspberry Pi.  The files are imported from the boot/ directory in

https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware

(The repository is very very large, so it's not imported wholesale.)

prebuilt/cmdline.txt is the b2g-specific linux startup command line.

prebuilt/config.txt contains b2g-specific parameters mostly relevant
for the Raspberry Pi's VideoCore chip.

prebuilt/kernel.img is built from the linux kernel source at

https://github.com/cgjones/linux

on the "rpi-gonk-3.12.y" branch.  This kernel source is forked from
the official upstream Raspberry Pi source at

https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux


## Build the default kernel

First download the Raspberry Pi toolchain from

https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools

Ensure that
$tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin is in
your $PATH.  Then configure and build the kernel with

$ cd $linux
$ make ARCH=arm bcmrpi_gonk_defconfig
$ make ARCH=arm -j8   # or whatever -j is right for your machine

The build artifact $linux/arch/arm/boot/zImage can be directly copied
over prebuilt/kernel.img.  To update your Raspberry Pi with this new
kernel, run

$ cd $b2g
$ ./build.sh
$ ./flash.sh boot


## Build a kernel with PiTFT support

Follow the same instructions as above, with one addition: after
cloning the linux repository, run

$ cd $linux/drivers/video/
$ git clone https://github.com/xobs/adafruit-rpi-fbtft.git fbtft

This pulls in the "fbtft" driver that PiTFT.

And, instead of configuring with `bcmrpi_gonk_defconfig`, run

$ make ARCH=arm bcmrpi_gonk_pitft_defconfig
